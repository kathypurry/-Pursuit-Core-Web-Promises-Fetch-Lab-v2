# Pursuit-Core-Web-Promises-Fetch-Lab

## Getting Started

- Fork this repo
- Clone the forked repository
- `cd` to the directory where you cloned it
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm test` to open the cypress testing window

> _Note_: Remember to `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` regularly

## 1. MVP

Use the [Official Joke API](https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api) and `fetch` to build the site described below:

- A list of ten jokes that are randomly loaded when the page is refreshed, each with the `"card"` class
- Clicking on a joke card should expand it and reveal the punchline
- Clicking on it again should contract it and hide the punchline
- A button with id `"reload"` that clears all the jokes on the screen and loads new random ones

## 2. Bonus

- Have a select at the top for either `general`, `random`, or `programming` and only load jokes of that type
- Keep track of all of the jokes the user has seen so far, and don't show them the same joke twice when they click a button for new jokes
